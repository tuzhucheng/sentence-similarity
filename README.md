# sentence-similarity

I plan to implement some models for sentence similarity found in the literature to reproduce and study them. They have a wide variety of application, including:

* **Paraphrase Detection**: Give two sentences, are the sentences paraphrases of each other?
* **Semantic Texual Similarity**: Given two sentences, how close are they in terms of semantic equivalence?
* **Natural Language Inference / Textual Entailment**: Can one sentence be inferred from another sentence (the premise)?
* **Answer Selection**: Given question-answer pairs, rank candidate answers based on relevance to question.
